# Chroma Icons
The 2.2 Geode port of **Mega Hack v7 Icon Effect**!
Besides original functions, this mod also has:  
#### Intergrated UI
This UI design is tested to fits various general display ratios besides 16:9, also fits some different texture fonts, and fits tpdea's Betterpause.
Yes Geode attributes that.
#### Set different colors for Gamemodes
You can still Set a color setup as common setup so it applys to all gamemodes for this player (P1/P2);
#### Seperate Riders
Set cube Riders' color diffrent from their ship/ufo vehicles but follow the cube's original color;
#### Ultimate Trigger
Toggle off the whole mod without having to reboot GD after you disable the mod in Geode's official mod list.

### How to Use
This mod adds a chroma icons button to Icon Select Menu *(GJGarageLayer)* and Pause Menu *(PauseLayer)*, so you can access the mod menu either in game menu or in playing a level.
Detailed description will be discribed in ReadMe.md under my repo.
