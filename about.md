# Chroma Icons
After nearly a month's effort, thousands of test, The **Icon Effect** is finally ported to Geode for GD2.2!  
Besides original functions, this mod also has:  
#### Intergrated UI
Yes Geode attributes that.  
This UI design is tested to fits various general display ratios besides 16:9, also fits different texture fonts, and fits tpdea's Betterpause.
#### Set different colors for Gamemodes
You can still Set a color setup as common setup so it applys to all gamemodes for this player (P1/P2);
#### Seperate Riders
Set cube Riders' color diffrent from their ship/ufo vehicles but follow the cube's original color;
#### Ultimate Trigger
Toggle off the whole mod without having to reboot GD after you disable the mod in Geode's official mod list.

### How to Use
This mod adds a chroma icons button to Icon Select Menu *(GJGarageLayer)* and Pause Menu *(PauseLayer)*, so you can change the icon effects either in game menu or in playing a level.  
Detailed description is given in my repo.

### Note that:
- <cy>Based on Pointercrate List Team's policy for Mega Hack v7's Icon Effects, editing Icon Effects in playing a demon list level is probably</c> <cr>**Not Allowed**</c> <cy>for record submission.</c>  
- I recommend you <cr>not to enable</c> any other Icon modifier mod (e.g. Same Dual Color) to avoid messing up with this one;  
- In the future, some game settings will be covered by this mod and <cr>**not taking effects anymore**</c>.You will be able to stop my mod from covering those settings by toggling off the option Cover Settings.  

### To Do
- More than 2 colors gradient  
- Set a icon effect set for single level  
- Flash pulse  
- Apply to editor test  
- Main Menu Effect Preview (perhaps?)  
- Set phase offset (perhaps)
