# Chroma Icons
### aka Icon Effect by Mega Hack v7 
The 2.2 Geode port of **Mega Hack v7 Icon Effect**!
Besides original functions, this mod also has:  
#### Intergrated UI
This UI design is tested to fits various general display ratios besides 16:9, also fits different texture fonts, and fits tpdea's Betterpause.  
#### Set different colors for Gamemodes
You can still Set a color setup as common setup so it applys to all gamemodes for this player (P1/P2);
#### Editor Chroma
Apply this mod even to Editor Playtest if you want!
#### Seperate Riders
Set cube Riders' color diffrent from their ship/ufo vehicles but follow the cube's original color;
#### Customize Phase
Customize Chroma Cycle Phase to make main/secondary/glow color in the same icon and P1/P2 color in dual mode syncs or keeps different.
#### Ultimate Trigger
Toggle off the whole mod without having to reboot GD after toggle off the mod in Geode's official mod list.

### How to Use
This mod adds a Chroma Icons button to Icon Select Menu *(GJGarageLayer)* and Pause Menu *(PauseLayer)*, so you can customize the icon effects either in game menu or in playing a level.  
Detailed description in under construction sry  

### Note that:
- I recommend you </font color="red>Disable</font> any other Icon Color modifier mod (e.g. Same Dual Color) to avoid messing up with this one;
Regarding Pointercrate List Team's policy for Mega Hack v7's Icon Effects, editing Icon Effects in playing a demon list level is probably </font color="red">Not Allowed</font> for record submission.   

### To Do
- More than 2 colors gradient
- Set an icon effect set for single level
- Flash pulse
- Quick Settings
- Main Menu Effect Preview (perhaps?)
- Pick color from Robtop's official color set
