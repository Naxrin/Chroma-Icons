# Chroma Icons
### aka Icon Effect by Mega Hack v7 
After nearly a month's effort, thousands of test, The **Mega Hack v7 Icon Effect** is finally ported to Geode for GD2.2!  
Besides original functions, this mod also has:  
#### Intergrated UI
This UI design is tested to fits various general display ratios besides 16:9, also fits different texture fonts, and fits tpdea's Betterpause.  
Yes Geode attributes that. 
#### Set different colors for Gamemodes
You can still Set a color setup as common setup so it applys to all gamemodes for this player (P1/P2);
#### Seperate Riders
Set cube Riders' color diffrent from their ship/ufo vehicles but follow the cube's original color;
#### Ultimate Trigger
Toggle off the whole mod without having to reboot GD after toggle off the mod in Geode's official mod list.

### How to Use
This mod adds a Chroma Icons button to Icon Select Menu *(GJGarageLayer)* and Pause Menu *(PauseLayer)*, so you can change the icon effects either in game menu or in playing a level.  
Detailed description in under construction sry

### Note that:
I recommend you not to enable any other Icon modifier mod (e.g. Same Dual Color) to avoid messing up with this one;  
Based on Pointercrate List Team's policy for Mega Hack v7's Icon Effects, editing Icon Effects in playing a demon list level is probably </font color="red">Not Allowed</font> for record submission.  
By activating this mod, the following game settings will be covered by this mod and </font color="red">not taking effects anymore</font>.  
*Switch Wave Trail Color*
*(will be more in the future update)*
you can stop my mod from covering those settings by toggling off the option Cover Settings.  

### To Do
More than 2 colors gradient  
Set a icon effect set for single level  
Flash pulse  
Apply to editor test  
Main Menu Effect Preview (perhaps?)  
Set phase offset (perhaps)
