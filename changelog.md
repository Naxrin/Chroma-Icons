### Bugfix
#### 1.Fix Robot/Spider Glow Not Working Bug!
How stupid can it be to chroma dynamic icons?

~~I removed the title image of about.md~~  
Fixed the issue that the title image of about.md displays unproperly in Medium Quality mobiles.
### New stuffs
#### 1.Chromatic icons in editor playtest!
Considering capability issues, applying to editor playtest is optional, you can disable it individually.
#### 2.Phase options!
- For now you can decide your secondary&glow color align with main color (keep the same) or keep a constant phase distance (keep different)  
- Also able to decide Player 2 color phase aligns with Player 1 or not
#### 3.One-time Pointercrate Submission Notify
Only take effects in the first time you enter the mod menu in playing an extreme demon (Yes I have to do this)
#### 4.Copy & Paste Color in Static/Gradient Menu
Copy a color and quick paste it somewhere else!
#### 5.Some Visual Updates to options menu
ScrollLayer option menu
Description button of the *Apply to Common* option (in case some guys don't understand what does this option do)
Switch Option Color (simple and cool)
### To Do
